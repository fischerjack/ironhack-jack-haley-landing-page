# This an incomplete project that was done in approximately 3 hours.
# Myself and a UX/UI designer, Haley Kirk, teamed up for a landing page competition.
# All of our coding bootcamp, IronHack, participated.
# Due to the severe time restraints, this HTML and CSS is full of "bad practice", such as the in-line styling of HTML elements.
